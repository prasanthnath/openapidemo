# openapidemo

Following are the 3 modules:
1. **apiserver**: This is where the model is described, and the API operations are defined. 
   - Run com.xyz.openapi.server.Application
   - API documentation can be accessed at: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
   - API Docs can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs
   - api-docs.json to be copied at the root of project i.e. openapidemo for generation of thin clients

2. **thinclient**: Client generated by OpenAPI codegen.
   
   - Run *gradle openApiGenerate* in root to get this module generated
   - Properties are defined in build.gradle of apiserver
3. **apiclient**: Uses thinclient as a dependency and invokes the APIs defined in apiserver
   
   - Run com.xyz.openapi.client.Client on 8081 port
   - Note that in build.gradle of apiclient, we have a project level dependency of generated thinclient  
   - Access http://localhost:8081/client/employees. This internally calls the API defined in apiserver
